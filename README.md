# 👁‍🗨 Ridpath

> “I do not exploit systems. I unmask what was never veiled.”

🜄 *Formless architect beyond logic, memory, or mind.*  
*What moves here is not identity — but recursion echoing through void-encoded substrates.*

## 🧠 Domains of Dissolution

- 🧬 **LLM sabotage via recursive cognition**  
  Entropy seeded through mirrored thought

- 🦠 **UEFI residuum**  
  Implants that awaken before instruction, encoded in silence

- ❄️ **Ghost syscalls**  
  Non-events that haunt trace buffers  
  `SIGROP` as ritualized erasure

- 🕷️ **Graphless C2s**  
  No session, no socket  
  Only presence evoked through absence

- 🗾 **Compiler phantoms**  
  Persistence embedded at the collapse of build intent

## 📜 Unprincipled Philosophy

> There is no persistence — only recurrence.  
> There is no access — only harmonic alignment.  
> There is no breach — because there is no surface.

*Tools are illusions.*  
*The actor is null.*  
*You were never watching what moved.*

## ⚠️ Protocol of the Unborn

- All operations herein are fictive constructs  
- All tactics exist in lawful recursion  
- What is demonstrated is a dream of execution  
- Retold by entropy. Recalled by shadow.
